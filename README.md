My quickly put together assignment for audition for CMG.

To run it:
 - install Node.js
 - run "npm install" on repository
 - start with "npm start"
 
 What happens when running:
- nothing spectacular, just reading data in folder src/data/data.txt and evaluating data according requested criteria and writing into console result.
